# Programs Installed
* Express

# Getting Started
* Create a server.js file.
* Create an app folder.
  * Inside the app folder is a data folder, a public folder, and a routing folder.
    * The data folder contains the friends.js folder which has the array of all the friends, their pictures and their scores.
    * The public folder contains the home.html which is the home page where the user can click the start survey page.  It also contains the survey.html page which contains the survey for the user to take to find their match.
    * The routing folder has the apiRoutes.js and the htmlRoutes.js files.  The htmlRoutes page joins the paths to the home.html page and the survey.html page.  The apiRoutes connects to the friends.js file and compares the user scores to the friend score to see the perfect match.
    
# Take the Survey
* When the user gets to the home page, there's a button for the user to press that will take them directly to the survey page.  There is a link at the bottom of the page that will show the array of the friends and the other link will show the github page of the app.  
* When the user goes to the survey page, it asks for the users name and a photo which are both required.  Than the user will answer the 10 questions in the survey.  When the user hits submit and modal will pop up of the matched friend.  Once the user hits the close button, the survey clears and they can start over again.
* When the user hits submit in the survey, in the terminal, it will show the user's name, photo link, and all of the user's input answers.  It will than show all of the closes matches from the friends array.
