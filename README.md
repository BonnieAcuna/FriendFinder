# Getting Started
* Create a server.js file.
* Create an app folder.
  * Inside the app folder is a data folder, a public folder, and a routing folder.
    * The data folder contains the friendship.js folder which has the array of all the friends, their pictures and their scores.
    * The public folder contains the home.html which is the home page where the user can click the start survey page.  It also contains the survey.html page which contains the survey for the user to take to find their match.
    * The routing folder has the apiRoutes.js and the htmlRoutes.js files.  The htmlRoutes page joins the paths to the home.html page and the survey.html page.  The apiRoutes connects to the friends.js file and compares the user scores to the friend score to see the perfect match.
